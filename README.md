A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:


Flutter Application: Fetch and Display Data from an API
Overview
This Flutter application is designed to fetch and display data from a given API with features such as pagination, lazy loading, and caching. The app is built using the BLoC pattern for state management, adhering to clean architecture principles, and implementing dependency injection.
Features
Pagination: Automatically loads more content as the user scrolls, allowing efficient handling of large datasets.
Lazy Loading: Improves performance by loading content only when necessary.
Caching: Reduces the need for repeated API requests by caching video data.
Error Handling: Handles potential errors during data retrieval or JSON parsing.
Responsive Reels Page Design: Mimics a reels page with smooth scrolling and pagination.
